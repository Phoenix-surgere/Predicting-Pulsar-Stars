# Predicting-Pulsar-Stars
Another Dataset taken from Kaggle, the purpose of which is to predict whether a Star is a Pulsar, a rare variant. It seems very well documented and structured, rich in features and interesting in its class imbalance, making it all that more interesting to both explore and model.
